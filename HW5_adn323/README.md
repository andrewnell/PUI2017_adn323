## Assignment 1
I completed assignment 1 by myself

In assignment 1 I created an data frame of random poisson distributions, which I then worked out the Z value of relative to the overall mean and standard deviation. I then plotted the Z values, which strongly correlated with a standard normal distribution. I then tested the distribution of z values against a standard normal distribution with the KS and AD tests which suggested they were from the same distribution. 

## Assignment 2
I worked on assignment 2 with the help of Jon Kastelan, he provided me with some suggestions on how to use Federica's formulas. The rest I did myself.

In Assignment 2 we had to create random distributions of the binomial and poisson distributions with different chracteristics (n and lambda respectively). We then conducted a variety of tests (KS, AD, KL entropy and Chi Square) based on the normalised distributions against a normal distribution to see what happens as the characteristic changes. This lead to the fact that with increasing characteristics, the normalised values align better.

## Assignment 3
I completed assignment 3 mostly by myself, but received input from several people including Kent Pan and Valeria Schiavon. I provided Jon kastelan with some assistance. 

In Assignment 3 we needed to import and merge some data sets on guns and murder rates. We then compared various columns within the combined data set to see how error and data vary, as well as trying to see how by changing how we mdimension data can change how we compare countries. We then visualised all these different things as we weroked through the assignment trying to see if there was any correlation between things such as mass shootings, firearm death rate and number of firearms.
