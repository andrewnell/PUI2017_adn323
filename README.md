# PUI2017_adn323

### HW1-2 

To complete HW1-2, the following steps were undertaken:

1. Created a repository for PUI2017

2. Opened bashrc to edit and added an alias and a directory name that can be seen in image below for direcory for PUI2017 directory: 

![bashrc aliases and functions](https://github.com/andrewnell/PUI2017_adn323/blob/master/bashrc%20Aliases%20v1%2020170917%20adn.PNG)

3. Afterwhich, I reset bashrc using the 'source' function and then tested the newly added directory shortcut and alias (See image below).

4. I then added the images to the github repository through the github website. 

5. I then edited the 'readme' file using Jupyter hub. (I realise I could have done this using emacs/VI etc. as well)

6. I then pull the file using the terminal and checked it in emacs to ensure that all the data was there and commited and pushed again to ensure this was visible in my github repo.
