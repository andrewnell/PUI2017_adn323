### Assignment 1
I worked with Jon Kastelan on Assignment 1 and received some support from Juan Sokoloff.

The assignment required the import and merging of a complex dataset with business information per zipcode. These were downloaded as individual years data and thus needed to be merged to ensure we had the whole data set togetehr.

After this, the data could be visualised as a time series for the number of businesses in a specifc zipcode per year, and we attempted to cluster different zipcodes by their time series trends using the Kmeans method.

There was definitely a clear overall NYC trend, however there were several zipcodes that behaved differently.

We then set about clustering the data using differnt techniques.

Afterwhich the clusters were plotted onto a map, so we could see if the neighbourhoods that were clustered together made sense and if we could pull any insights out of it.

### Assignment 2
I worked alone on assignment 2.

This assignment required that a loop be constructed to iterate the sleection of the centroids of the clusters of the random data sets that we had and at the same time we visualise this shift and the change in centroid. The idea was to turn the visualisation into an animation.
