### Assignment 1

I completed the assignment by myself, with some discussion with Jon Kastelan and Jack Lundquist.

In the assignment We had to look at a data set for the ridership of the subway looking at ridhership type, stations and over time. 

The trick was to be able to manipulate the 3 dimensinal nature that the data came in through the use of reshaping the matices. 

We wanted to first find a significant event,which was Hurrican Sandy.

Then we had to compare Ridership type of the period and we could identify drops in specific use of ridership types and the starting of new ones. As well as small changes.

The last question wanted to identify any periodicity in specific stations. There were 4 stations who had peridoicity over approxuimately 52 weeks.
