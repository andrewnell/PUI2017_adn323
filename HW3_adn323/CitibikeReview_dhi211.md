## Markdown file for Andrew's HW3.


Questions in lowercase; ANSWERS IN UPPER CASE


a. verify that their Null and alternative hypotheses are formulated correctly


NULL AND ALT HYPOTHESIS FORMULATED CORRECTLY


b. verify that the data supports the project: i.e. if the a data has the appropriate features (variables) to answer the question, and if the data was properly pre-processed to extract the needed values (there is some flexibility here since the test was not chosen yet)


DATA SUPPORTS PROJECT


c. chose an appropriate test to test H0 given the type of data, and the question asked. You can refer to the flowchart of statistical tests for this in the slides, or here, or Statistics in a Nutshell.


I DON'T FULLY GRASP WHAT THE CORRECT ANSWER HERE WOULD BE. GIVEN THAT IT IS TWO SETS OF DATA, AND GIVEN WHAT THIS ARTICLE SAYS https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3116565/, I WOULD SAY YOU COULD ADD SOME ELEMENT OF PARAMETRIC MODELING TO TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS.
