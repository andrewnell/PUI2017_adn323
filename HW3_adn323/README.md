I worked on Assignment 2 and 3 with Jon Kastelan, he completed Assignment 3 and I completed assignment 2

###Assignment 1

I worked by myself but received some help from Ruben Hambardzumyan

Assignment 1 consisted of creating random samples with random sample sizes of 5 different distribution types (Chi Squared, Normal, Binomial, Exponential and Poisson) and then visualising the mean of each sample to determine the actual mean relative to the set mean to show the nature of sample size with mean of random samples.

###Assignment 2

I pulled the data onto cdf and saved in PUIdata and then used the data and wrangled the data frame to compare Customer type and rides over 45 mintues to prove whether there are more non-subscribers who spend long on the bikes.


###Assignment 3

We assessed bus times and determined that the new route had a significant affect at reducing bus times
