# The Chernoff faces of CUSP 2017/18

The visualization I have chosen is a plot of **Chernoff faces**. 

I compiled a series of aggregate country level statistics for each of the countries represented by CUSP students in the 2017/18 class - along with a few additional misc. countries for comparison purposes. The statistics were mainly urban in nature, relating to the overall economy, mobility, health, education, technology, industry and law and order. A summary of the data is provided in the data section later. The R code is also [provided](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jkastelan/PUI2017_jlk635/master/HW8_jlk635/HW8_jlk635_Code_for_Chernoff_faces_in_R.txt) in the repo for reference.
