### I worked with Jon Kastelan and Emily Hansen on Q2

### I worked on question 1 and 3 by myself

### I worked with help from Alex Shannon for Q4

Question 1 was reviewing the work of Tarek.

Question 2 was reviewing 3 articles and seeing what test they used and what the various components of the test are including Independant and Dependant variables and understanding what their null hypotheses were. 

Question 3 was using the Chi Squared and Z tests in comparing two data sets. and testing whether the differences are negligible so that we can determine if the program is effective in changing the lives of former convicts.

Question 4 was data wrangling and using statistical methods to see if there are relationships between our data sets and the hypthesis posed in the questions, can we reject the null hypothesis and confirm the alternative ones.

  # FBB why did you look for a paper not on PLOS one? I specifically indicated to look for papers on plos one. then the paper you found outside plosone does not report a significance, which is probably something that would have not been accepted by the plosone editors.
  # also your LogReg has 2 null hypothesis. which is the proper null that was tested with the setup described by your table?
