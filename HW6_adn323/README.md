I completed the assignment by myself, however discussed some coding and methods with Jon Kastelan. 
I gave some advice to Valeria Schiavon, Sarah Schoengold on plotting a quadratic line.

The work consisted of several technical skills including:
* Importing data and converting to viable formats
* Data Wrangling and Merging to make useful data sets
* Visualisation of data to see if there are any trends
* Conversion fo data to logarithms to see if the relationship is exponential
* Fitting of linear and quadratic models onto the plots to see if any of the regressions make sense and fit the data
* Using CHi Squared test to confirm if the models developed are accurate models or cannot be ised to significantly measure the predict 
* Likelihood comparisons to assess whether the more complex model added any accuracy to the model
