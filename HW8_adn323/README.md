Data was downloaded for the city of Cape Town from:
http://web1.capetown.gov.za/web1/opendataportal/DatasetDetail?DatasetName=Freehold%20residential%20property%20valuations%20(median%20values) and http://web1.capetown.gov.za/web1/opendataportal/DatasetDetail?DatasetName=Water%20consumption to observe water consumption per suburb and compare it with some valuation of income. 

In this case, there was no income data, so median property value was used as an indicator of income. This assumption is possible due to the economic disparity in CapeTown and the legacy of Apartheid which means these communities are split spatially along economic and racial lines. 

The water consumption was then plotted against median residential property valuation to determine if there was some linear relationship. 

### As the null hypothesis would be that water consumption would be the same or decrease with increasing median residential property price 

Although there is a clesr relationship, the data is too spread out to determine a relationship statistically. 
Better more fine data with better filterijng could improve this.
